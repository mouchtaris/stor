1. parser actions result in restricted environmentally aware
   closed actions. These are not enough to be directly executed
   and be flexible enough to handle both the cache and the
   input link-connections.
   There should be an additional layer introduced, which will
   receive the parsed commands and transform them into completely
   closed commands, each one being a closer of everything it needs
   in order to perform.
